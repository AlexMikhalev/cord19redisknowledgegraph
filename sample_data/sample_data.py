paragraphs="""Influenza is transmitted by inhalation of direct respiratory droplets, and direct or indirect contact via fomites (1, 2). Concern with potential hospital-based transmission of influenza has come to the forefront due to the increased virulence of past influenza seasons, significant changes to influenza vaccine production, and pandemic flu due to the novel swine-origin novel influenza A (H1N1) virus. The outbreak of the H1N1 virus, first identified in the United States in April 2009, led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to issue extended guidelines for health care personnel to prevent health-care-associated transmission of the viral infections, including both preventive measures and procedures for those who became ill (3). These guidelines, which outline specific strategies for prevention and control of influenza in acute care facilities, supplement CDC's 2008 infection control recommendations (4). Despite these strategic references, at least 48 cases of influenza A (H1N1) strain have been reported among health care personnel since the initial outbreak, indicating that compliance with the CDC's recommendations may be lower than desired (5). Although there is limited and controversial evidence regarding the effectiveness of either surgical 
or N95 masks in reducing transmission of the influenza virus, studies of occupational exposures during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak suggest that the wearing of either surgical or N95 masks might be protective in the health care setting (6, 7, 8, 9, 10). A recent study on the use of surgical masks compared to N95 masks by nurses in Canada demonstrated similar rates of laboratory-confirmed influenza 
infection (11). Influenza infection control is particularly important in the emergency department (ED) because both index cases and more severe cases are expected to present to the ED, and the phenomenon of ED crowding continues to increase at an alarming rate across the United States (12). Compliance with infection control guidelines for influenza is generally unknown in the ED, and effective yet low-resource training is 
needed to educate staff on the importance of decreasing the potential for transmission of the virus in the ED. One potentially powerful tool that can be employed is the electronic medical record (EMR). The EMR has progressed rapidly over the past couple of decades from passive record keeping to systems including functions of order entry, provider notifications and alerts, and patient tracking. EMR systems have been successfully used for improving adherence to clinical guidelines such as pressure ulcer prevention, decreasing adverse drug reactions, and monitoring of infectious diseases, as well as compliance with pneumonia guidelines (13, 14). To our knowledge, the use of this tool for infection control and prevention has not been reported or published. This pilot study aimed to compare compliance with CDC infection control guidelines in confirmed cases of influenza in an urban, academic hospital ED before and after a novel EMR-based educational intervention. Our hypothesis was that there is inconsistent utilization of infection control precautions for influenza cases in the ED, and that compliance could be improved by 
an educational intervention program using an EMR. This study was a retrospective analysis of patients selected from the ED census of an urban, academic hospital with an annual patient volume of 62,000 visits per year. We included all patients with a diagnosis of laboratory-confirmed 
influenza (by rapid nasopharyngeal influenza testing) for the 2007\xe2\x80\x932008 (October 1, 2007 to April 30, 2008) and 2008\xe2\x80\x932009 (October 1, 2008 to April 24, 2009) influenza seasons for comparison. We identified patients through the ED EMR system (Picis, Inc., Wakefield, MA). The database was queried for all patients with the discharge diagnosis of \xe2\x80\x9cInfluenza (identified by flu swab only)\xe2\x80\x9d for the study period. The study was approved by our Institutional Review Board (IRB). The requirement for informed consent of study subjects was waived by the IRB. Limited patient encounter data were collected, including ED location (room, hallway, or chair), Radiology Department transport, documentation of the use of droplet precautions, and week and month of ED visit. Patient charts were reviewed for documentation of compliance with CDC infection control guidelines for influenza. Figure 1\ndisplays recommended droplet-based transmission precautions. For the purposes of this study, we defined appropriate infection control precautions as: 1) patient is assigned to a private room or cohorted or 2) if the patient was moved, transported, or placed in a hallway, the patient was given a surgical mask. Our ED has no standard intervention or 
protocol to identify and isolate patients with respiratory symptoms. In October 2008, before the start of the 2008\xe2\x80\x932009 influenza season, the investigators sent an informational e-mail to all providers (nurses, technicians, and physicians working in the ED) via the Picis EMR system, explaining the importance and proper use of infection control precautions for patients with clinically suspected or confirmed influenza. This e-mail was repeated every month from October through April as a reminder to staff. In addition, a reminder for droplet precautions 
was added next to the electronic order checkbox, accessed when ordering an influenza nasopharyngeal swab, in the Picis EMR beginning in September 2008. This EMR intervention was visible both to nursing staff and physicians who were entering or viewing the order. A retrospective chart review was performed for the 2007\xe2\x80\x932008 influenza season and the same review was performed for the 2008\xe2\x80\x932009 influenza season. Compliance with patient assignment and transport precautions, our outcome measure, was compared between the two seasons with descriptive statistics and chi-squared analysis using Microsoft \xc2\xae Excel software (2003 version, CHITEST statistical function; Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) with an alpha value of 0.05. No other infection control interventions geared toward influenza were implemented in the ED during the study period, beyond routine processes. A potential confounder to our study is the impact of public health recommendations after the novel H1N1 outbreak in April 2009. To minimize this effect, for the 2008\xe2\x80\x932009 influenza season we did not include cases that presented after the onset of media coverage of the novel influenza H1N1 virus. This was done to avoid confounding the data due to an increased public 
and staff awareness of influenza. Thus, we only included patients through April 24, 2009, which was before release of recommendations to ED staff obtained from the CDC and Department of Health. Comparable numbers of patients were seen in the ED for the 2007\xe2\x80\x932008 and the 2008\xe2\x80\x932009 influenza seasons (36,942 patients and 38,186 patients, respectively), with no change in the total number of private beds assigned between the two time periods. A total of 711 influenza swabs were ordered in the ED for the 2007\xe2\x80\x932008 season and 931 swabs 
were ordered during the 2008\xe2\x80\x932009 season. During the 2007\xe2\x80\x932008 influenza season, the ED had 129 swab-confirmed cases of 
influenza in the study period and droplet precautions were used in 38 (29%) cases. Within the subgroup of patients who were moved to the hallway or Radiology, defined precautions were used in 7 (7%) cases. During the following 2008\xe2\x80\x932009 influenza season, through April 24, 
2009, the ED had 112 swab-confirmed cases of influenza, and infection control precautions were used in 50 (45%) cases. For the subgroup of patients who were moved to the hallway or Radiology, infection control precautions were used in 20 (24%) cases. Overall compliance with transmission precautions increased between the two seasons, from 29% to 45%, with a p-value of 0.015. Compliance with precautions for patients moved to the hallway or radiology increased from 7% to 24%, with a p-value of 0.001. Figure 2, Figure 3\nshow the number of patients diagnosed with influenza who were placed in transmission precautions during their ED stay, including movement from private rooms to the hallway or Radiology, for the 2007\xe2\x80\x932008 (Figure 2) and 2008\xe2\x80\x932009 (Figure 3) seasons. Despite our intervention, compliance with infection control precautions remained below desirable levels for the ED setting. One major limitation of this study is that we examined only confirmed cases 
of influenza at a single institution. Ideally, all patients with suspected influenza should be placed in droplet precautions during the influenza season. Our numbers represent a fraction, though we believe it to be a representative one, of the entire patient cohort who should have received droplet precautions during the course of their ED visit. Also, because we assessed compliance based on charting documentation, it is possible that there was under- or over-reporting of droplet precautions. Although there is a section of the chart in which to document isolation precautions, this section is not mandatory and staff members were not specifically instructed to complete it. Furthermore, we were unable to 
measure other important elements of droplet precautions for those patients assigned to a private room, such as appropriate hand hygiene and use of surgical masks by ED staff. We did not measure cases of ED-based transmission. This makes it uncertain what the transmission rate would be for those non-compliant with precautions, and what impact other factors may have on transmission, such as immunization rates of patients and staff. In addition, factors that affect compliance may vary at different institutions, and compliance rates may be different in non-urban, community institutions, or those that have established protocols for respiratory chief complaints. Given the possibility of a higher-volume influenza season at best or an upcoming influenza pandemic at worst, EDs will play a significant role in containment of index cases and prevention of transmission of influenza within the hospital and into the community, both by their infection control compliance and by staff and patient 
education. Passive reminders to ED staff may help to improve compliance, however, more research studies should be undertaken to determine what interventions have the most significant impact, including active protocols, changes to hospital policies and procedures, or simple educational interventions. The electronic medical record may be a useful tool for improving compliance with transmission-based precautions, by implementing direct reminders on order sets and informational mailings to staff, and by tracking ED compliance.
